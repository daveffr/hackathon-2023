            Many people know that the most effective way to learn a language is to practice with native speakers. 
            There are specific aspects to a language that simply cannot be taught or covered in books. Flow, slang, casual sentence structure, 
            and even accents are so much easier to pickup when communicating with a native speaker.

            Unfortunately, not everyone has access to 
            the resources to easily meet with somene else that speaks the native language that they are trying to learn. That's where BabbelBaddies 
            comes in, all you need to do is fill out a form with some basic info, and we'll generate matches with other users 
            who know the language you're trying to learn!

            We also include a section for you to fill out your hobbies, so you can find matches that share common interests to you! This makes it easier
            for conversation to flow when you eventually get to talk with your matches!
